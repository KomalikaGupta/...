        program: A set of instructions with specific task is called as "program".

 
software: A set of programs or collection of programs with multiple task is called as "software".

   software types
  1)System software:which software understandble by the machine lang that is "system software".
  it is developed based on c,c++ program langs.
   example:o.s
  ms-dos,ms-windows,unix,linux
 
2)Application software:Which software understandble by the user instructions that is "application software"
  1)stand-alone:this software can execute on single machine.this software is called as "desktop" applications.
ex:  ms-office,anti-virus,media player..etc
 2)web-application:this software can execute any machine with help of browser.this software supported "network".[LAN,WAN]
  ex: google,facebook..etc
3)mobile:
these can execute in smartphones or tabs
ex: whatsapp,instagram...etc
  note:the above stand-alone,web applications developed using "java"  or ".net"

 
   c=> c++ => java =>python
   JAVA:
  1)it is one of the high-level programing lang.
 2)it is developed by sun microsystems in 1995 .
  "james ghosling" and "team" developed "oak" software.
 it is also called "java"


   translators:
      1)compiler-   all lines convert into machine code.
          ex:c[TURBOC,DEVC,..],c++,java,.net...
      2)interpreter- step by step convert into machine code.
            ex:html,jscript,python,java

 java programing lang features:



1)simple programing:it is simple to created code compare to c,c++.
 2)object-oriented programing:it is one of the fully-object oriented programing.In this the code created based on "classes and objects."
  3)secured:it is one of the high-level security in built java programs.
4)portable:One machine java code easy code access to another machine.
5)platform independent:it is one of the platform independent programin lang that means one machine java code can execute any o.s with help of "jvm".
  6)dynamic :java is a dynamic memory allocation program lang.these is no memory wastage because of "garbage collector".
7)interpreter:it is one of the interpret class file into bytes code with help of "jvm".
8)robust: it is one of the strong programing lang "high memory "features and "exception handling"
9)multi-threading:it is one of major feature of java program.thread is nothing but "task".multiple threads at a time can execute parrell.it is save the execution time.
    using java type of applications:
   1)stand-alone[notepad]
  2)webbased[facebook]
3)enterprise[banking]
4)mobile[android]
5)games
6)bigdata process[hadoop]
 7)selinum [testing tools]
     java editions:
  1)J2SE[JAVA to STANDARD EDITION] =core java
  2)J2EE [JAVA TO ENTERPRISE EDITION] =advanced java =>frameworks
3)J2ME[JAVA TO MICRO EDITION]=   android
      J2SE:this edition is used to develop the stand alone application with help of 'oops'
  J2EE:this edition is used to develop the web application with help of JSP,JDBC,SERVELETS,....
J2ME:this edition is used to develop mobile applications with help of "ANDROID"
